## üîê Cryptographic Attacks

### AES-CBC Padding Oracle Attack

The Padding Oracle Attack exploits vulnerabilities in the implementation of padding validation in AES-CBC mode encryption.

#### How It Works

1. **CBC Mode Basics**: In CBC mode, each plaintext block is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before encryption.
2. **Padding Vulnerability**: When decrypting, systems check if the padding is valid and may reveal this information through errors.
3. **The Attack**: By manipulating ciphertext blocks and observing padding validation responses, an attacker can gradually decrypt the message.

#### Tool Implementation

Our tool simulates a vulnerable server that leaks padding information and demonstrates the systematic decryption of ciphertext without knowing the key.

### RSA Attacks

#### Wiener's Attack

Targets RSA implementations with small private exponents.

**How It Works**:
- Uses continued fractions to find the private key when d is small relative to N
- Exploits the mathematical relationship between public and private keys
- Works when d < N^0.25

#### Franklin-Reiter Related Message Attack

Exploits when two related messages are encrypted with the same modulus.

**How It Works**:
- Requires two messages where one is linearly related to the other
- Uses polynomial greatest common divisor computations
- Recovers plaintext without factoring N or finding the private key

#### Pollard's Rho Algorithm

A factorization method that can break RSA when N has small prime factors.

**How It Works**:
- Uses a pseudorandom sequence to detect cycles
- Employs Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm
- Efficiently finds factors without brute force

### Vigen√®re Cipher Attacks

#### Kasiski Examination

A classic technique to break polyalphabetic substitution ciphers like Vigen√®re.

**How It Works**:
1. **Finding Repeated Sequences**: Identifies repeated text segments
2. **Key Length Determination**: Calculates distances between repetitions to determine possible key lengths
3. **Frequency Analysis**: Once the key length is known, individual Caesar ciphers can be analyzed
4. **Key Recovery**: Employing frequency analysis on each position to recover the key
